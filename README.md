Punchr - A restaurant rewards app to incentivize in-store purchases

The app utilizes the Java Swing GUI toolkit with a mySQL connection to three schemas. Features include registering capabilities for users and restaurant staff,
login capabilities with credential verification, and real-time rewards for various limited/unlimited incentives.

Welcome reward is given during registration and is available from the first login.
Several rewards are based on the number of "Punches" the customer has received (limit 1 per visit) incentiving customers to return again for more rewards.
